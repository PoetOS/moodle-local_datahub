# Export

## Exporting Grade Information from Moodle via DH
Data Hub can export final grade information (number and/or letter grades) in CSV format. This can be imported to an SIS/ERP record keeping program (Banner, Peoplesoft, SAP). What is provided by Data Hub is a regularly exported CSV file with either incremental data (grades changed/updated since the previous export) or a full export of all grade data on the system. Custom user profile fields can be added to this export.

Access export settings by going to the Administration block > Site Administration > Plugins > Local plugins > Data Hub plugins > Version 1 export. The screen in the following image will be shown.
