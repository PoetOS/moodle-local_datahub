ata Hub Logs:
Data Hub for Moodle 2 now includes a log page where you can view the logs from your imports and exports. Go to the Administration block > Site Administration > Reports > Data Hub logs.

The log viewing screen provides the ability to filter what logs you see, to view summary information about success and failure of import and exports, and the ability to download and view the full logs.

Logs can also be viewed via SFTP if you have set up the SFTP folder. At midnight, 12:00am, the logs for the day are compressed into one zip file with a date stamp.

To access more information about logs, visit the [Data Hub Logs Documentation](http://rlcommunity.remote-learner.net/mod/book/view.php?id=59&chapterid=512).
