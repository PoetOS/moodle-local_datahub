# Datahub
Moodle is a powerful system for delivering courses, however there are often times when users need to integrate with information from other systems such as SIS, EPR, HR, and Financial Record keeping systems. To facilitate this, Remote-Learner has built the Data Hub, a tool for 2 way communication of information between Moodle and other systems - users, courses, enrollments in and grades out. DH also provides a way to quickly set up Moodle courses by uploading a formatted CSV file and using template courses.
## About this repository
This repository is separated into branches for each supported version. For Moodle versions, branches are named like MOODLE_XX_STABLE. For Totara versions, branches are named like TOTARA_XX_STABLE. The “XX” corresponds to the version that branch is for. For example, MOODLE_27_STABLE would be for Moodle 2.7. These branches contain production-ready, stable code.
